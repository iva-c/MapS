**MapS - a map for people with multiple sclerosis**

The goal of this project was creation of a map of Ajdovčšina (where the hackathon took place) with all obstacles and infrastructure relevant for patients with multiple sclerosis. Additionally, we created a heatmap grading locations based on surrounding infrastructure. 

We collected information about obstacles, pharmacies, benches, water points, pharmacies and other relevant infractructure from OpenStreetMap API. A full list of selected features is avalible in _TBA_.
